## About Me

I am a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at New York University (NYU), advised by Dr. Qi Sun. My research interests center on accelerating and improving graphics systems using machine learning techniques, with a primary interest in 3-D and extended reality (XR) applications. Additionally, I am interested in studying and exploiting human perception, through cognitive, perceptual, vision sciences, to enhance the experience and draw inspiration from.

I achieved my B.S. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2024, where I was advised by Dr. Thad Starner.
